# ds-areas (Dark Souls Areas)

#### Author: Joel Coddington-Lopez

This project is my love letter to Fromsoftware's Dark Souls franchise. I wanted to explore a few of my favorite areas from the series and show them off in a React app.

The site will include:
- A homepage leading to the different routes
- Six different routed pages, each for a different area, including explanation and images
    - Two from Dark Souls I
    - Two from Dark Souls II
    - Two from Dark Souls III
- A submission form for the user to submit their own favorite area with drag-and-drop for image submissions
